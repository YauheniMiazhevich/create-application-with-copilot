# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines

### Architecture Patterns
- Always use controllers for API endpoints
- Always use dependency injection
- Use the repository pattern for data access

### Code Organization
- Use individual files for classes, interfaces, DTOs, etc.
- Follow standard .NET structure with appropriate folders (Controllers, Services, Repositories, Models, Interfaces, etc.)
- Keep separation of concerns

### Best Practices
- Follow .NET best practices and conventions
- Follow OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) standards
- Use meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) where it makes sense
- Implement proper error handling and validation

### Workflow
- Always show me your plan first, before you start implementing
- Break down complex tasks into clear steps
- Explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions
